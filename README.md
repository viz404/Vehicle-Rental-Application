# drivezy-clone
This is the clone of a car/bike booking site drivezy where you can hire self-driving vehicles for a certain period of time. This is a part of our Masai curriculum to clone an e-commerce website. It is not a replica and it does not contain all the features present in the site.
# Description
This site lets book a vehicle form some specific locations for a certain period of time. We can also book multiples vehicles at the same time by adding items to the cart of quickly book a vehicle using the Quick book button.
 This site uses the technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the various sorting and filtering algorithms. the original site is not responsive but we tried to make it as much responsive as possible. There were a lot of challenges including to seperate items to be added in cart and booking via quick book button.
Some of the features like listing our vehicle on this site are yet to be implemented.
There was a lot of learning through this project as we learned to build modals, carousels, implementing a common sig-up/login button and many more.
